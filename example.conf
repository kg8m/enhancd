# For details, write the following.
#
ENHANCD_AUTOADD='true'
#
# First, add all of the hierarchy of the directory of full path of to

#
#   example:
#       $ cd /path/to/hoge/etc
#
#       * Add  /path
#       * Add  /path/to
#       * Add  /path/to/hoge
#         NOT  /path/to/hoge/etc
#
# Secondly, add depth 1 of the directory directly under the moved directory to
# the enhancd database.
#
#   example:
#       $ cd /path/to/hoge/etc
#
#       * Add  /path/to/hoge/etc/dir_a

#   Note: If you specify a large number, there is a case in which the screen is

# Use the -l option if you want to tab complement all of history as a candidate.
